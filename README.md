👋 Hi, I’m @Rahul Rawat.

👀 I’m interested in building high-performance mobile apps, real-time communication systems, and working on innovative projects at the intersection of IoT and software.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced media streaming with flutter_webrtc and exploring performance optimization techniques in Flutter.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Flutter, live streaming, and Bluetooth-based IoT solutions.
